Changes since Agent-2.9
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  1)  Added support for two new compartments - Code and Priority.  Also
      added methods for these two items.

  2)  Made Agent-2.91 sleep and wake methods backwardly compatible with 
      Agent-2.9's packself and unpackself (not so much a change,  just a 
      notification)

  3)  Renamed packself and unpackself to more appropriate names: sleep and
      wake, respectively.

  4)  More podstyle documention included.

  5)  You can now type 'make dist' if you want to give this away to your
      friends (please do (-: )

  6)  Added a docs/ subdir.  This contains the INSTALL, README,  and FAQ
      documents.  Also included is a very rough draft in HTML for
      Agentspace.

  7)  The Web page now has a lot more information on it =>

  8)  I am looking for someone to donate me a mailing list :) any takers?
