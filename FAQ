Agent FAQ
-=-=-=-=-


  Q. What does Agent do?
  
  A. Agent allows perl to access agentspaces.

  
  Q. What is agentspace? 

  A. Agentspace is the area a software agent reserves for variables,
     it is language-independent (ie,  just because Agent happens to
     be a perl module,  it doesn't mean you can't write a Tcl extension
     to use a module packed via packself.)  Variables within agentspace
     are all internal to the agent,   and are not affected by the language
     used to create them or modify them.


  Q. What are some possible uses?

  A. The uses are many.  For instance,  AgentPenguin (A module I am working
	allows agentspace to be sent via the Penguin module,  with the Penguin
     code stored within the agentspace.


  Q. Who is doing all this?

  A. I am,  err,  yeah.  James Duncan.  If you have any comments on Agent,
     please send them to me -> jduncan@hawk.igs.net.


  Q. How can I help?

  A. You can use Agent.  I'm sure you can think of a way to use it :-).  If
	you find it restrictive,  or unversatile,  please email me,  and let 
	me know what you find resrictive and unversatile.  I am more than
     willing to code new features into Agent,  and into the agentspace
	definition.


  Q. Is there a Web Page?

  A. James is behind this -> of course there is!  It can be found at
     http://www.hawk.igs.net/~jduncan/agent/ - it isn't anything special,
     but I'll announce it there first.
