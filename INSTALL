---------------------
Installing Agent Perl
---------------------

Get Tom-2.04 AlphaThree and apply the patch (see below).  Note that Tom-3.00
is incompatible with this version.

In general, the following should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install


Apply the Patch
---------------

Included with this distribution is a patch for Tom.pm v2.04 AlphaThree.  To
apply the patch go to Class-Tom-2.04's parent directory, and type:

	patch -p0 < Tom.pm.patch-spurkis-a3-01

Or just apply the patch manually - it's a simple two line fix.


Note for Win32 Users
--------------------

If you don't have a make utility, try setting your PERL5LIB environment
variable to point to the Agent Perl distribution.  If that doesn't work, try
copying all of the .pm files into your site-perl directory, making sure to
keep the directory structure intact.

Anyone willing to compile a PPM for Agent Perl is more than welcome!


Please read the README file before you start to play :-).
