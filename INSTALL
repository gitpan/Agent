Installing Agent
----------------

Pre-requisites
--------------

You _must_ have the following modules installed on your system in order for
Agent to function properly:

	Tom-2.00 (and inherently Protect, Safe, MD5, & Data:Dumper)
	[IO]

IO and Safe are now distributed with the Perl core, so if you have Perl
5.004, don't worry about them.  If you don't, you can pick up the latest
versions from your local CPAN mirror.  Both Tom and Protect can be found at
James Duncan's website:

	http://www.hawk.igs.net/~jduncan


Installing
----------

In general, the following should work:

	edit $Hostname in Agent.pm (see 'Configuring Agent')
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install


Note for Win32 Users
--------------------

If you're running Win32, you'll be asked if you want Agent installed
directly, or in the standard [above] fashion.  Unless you had the guts to
build perl yourself, answer yes to this question.  And don't try to 'make'
or 'make install' a non-existant Makefile :-).


Configuring Agent
-----------------

I haven't added ip-resolution to Agent yet, so you'll have to enter your ip
address manually.  To do this, just edit the 'Agent.pm' file, and set:

	$Hostname = 'your.ip.address.here'	# somewhere near the top

In addition to this, if you have Tom-2.00 (and you _should_), you'll have to
apply the patch-file I've included ('Tom-2.00-03.patch'), or simply just
copy 'Tom.pm.new' over 'Tom.pm'.  This patch adds some functions that should
be included in the next release of Tom, and that are required by Agent.


Please read the README file before you start to play :-).
