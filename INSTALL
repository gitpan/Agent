Installing Agent
----------------

Pre-requisites
--------------

You _must_ have the following modules installed on your system in order for
Agent to function properly:

	Class::Tom-2.03+ (and inherently: Safe, MD5, & Data:Dumper)
	[IO]

IO, Safe, and Data::Dumper are now distributed with the Perl core, so if you
have Perl 5.004_04, don't worry about them.  If not, you can pick them (and
Tom) up from your nearest CPAN mirror.


Installing
----------

In general, the following should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install


Note for Win32 Users
--------------------

If you're running Win32, you'll be asked if you want Agent installed
directly, or in the standard [above] fashion.  Unless you've built perl
yourself, answer yes to this question.  And don't try to 'make' or
'make install' a non-existant Makefile ;-).


Please read the README file before you start to play :-).
