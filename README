Agent has been worked out a little more.  Much of what I wanted to do
yesterday,  but didn't have time is now done.  If you are interested in
really dirty hacks (as opposed to hacks),  you can take a look at the old
code at ftp://ftp.hawk.igs.net/pub/users/jduncan/Agent/Agent-2.0a.tar.gz. 
It is fairly similar to todays release,  but I've changed things like the
variable writing and such.

All complaints should be directed to jduncan@hawk.igs.net.

Regards,
James.
