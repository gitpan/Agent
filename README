  Agent provides object methods for creating and accessing agentspace (A
language/platform independent software agent).   Version 2.91 has a couple
of changes since 2.9. $self->{'Code'} and $self->{'Priority'} now exist and
are packable within the agentspace.  $self->{'Scope'} has dissapeared,  I
don't know really why it was there in the first place :-).  
  $self->{'Code'} and $self->{'Priority'} will be used in the upcoming 
AgentPenguin kit that I am writing,  if you are interested,  and have
suggestions,  I'm open to all.

  See the file CHANGES for more information on what has taken place since
the Wednesday on which I first uploaded Agent-2.9.  Also take a look at
everything underneath the docs/ subdirectory.  It'll probably have a lot of
the answers you are looking for.

James
