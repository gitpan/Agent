These are some things I'd like to do before releasing Agent 3.01.

    -	Agent identification is slightly broken: it doesn't return the
	current state of the agent.
    -	Agent::Message should support MD5 checksums.
    -	Make Agent smart enough to figure out the IP address of the
	local host.
    -	Make an Agent::Socket test file.

Other goals:
    -	support the KQML/KIF communication standards implemented as classes
	(perhaps external to Agent?).
    -	direct support for PGP signatures & encryption.
    -	make sure security features work properly.
