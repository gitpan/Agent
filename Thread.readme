Thread Suppport
---------------
Agent threads are still considered alpha at the moment.  So far, they have
worked for me, but I haven't done anything complicated with them yet. :)

I would _like_ to make sending and recieving messages near-transparent by,
for example, having a queue of incoming/outgoing messages, assigning one
thread to handle all incoming data and another to handle all outgoing.

And I've got some other ideas too, but they are all just dreams at the
moment.
