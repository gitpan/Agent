Agent FAQ

  Q. What does Agent do?
  
  A. Agent allows perl to access agentspaces.

  
  Q. What is agentspace? 

  A. Agentspace is the area a software agent reserves for variables, code, 
     and priority levels.
       It is language-independent (ie,  just because Agent happens to
     be a perl module,  it doesn't mean you can't write a Tcl extension
     to use an agentspace packed via packself.)  Variables within agentspace
     are all internal to the agent,   and are not affected by the language
     used to create them or modify them.


  Q. Will Agentspace handle its own transportation,  or will it 
     rely on host machines for the transport method?

  A. By coding in it's own tranportation system,  Agentspace will make
     itself a) overweight and b) not a true agent.  A true agent is fully
     transportable,  and in order to make it internally  transportable
     it would need to rely on the original machine.  Agentspace

  Q. Who is doing all this?

  A. I am,  err,  yeah.  James Duncan.  If you have any comments on Agent
     and Agentspace, please send them to me -> jduncan@hawk.igs.net.  I'm
     doing it in my spare time when I'm not at school,  so cut me some
     slack,  please?


  Q. How can I help?

  A. You can use Agent.  I'm sure you can think of a way to use it :-).  If
     you find it restrictive,  or unversatile,  please email me,  and let 
     me know what you find resrictive and unversatile.  I am more than
     willing to code new features into Agent,  and into the agentspace
     definition.


  Q. Is there a Web Page?

  A. James is behind this! of course there is!  It can be found at
     http://www.hawk.igs.net/~jduncan/agent/ - it isn't anything special,
     but I'll announce it there first.
