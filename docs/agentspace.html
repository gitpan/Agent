<b><font size="+2">The Purpose of Information Agents</font></b>
<p>
With the growth of both Local Area Networks and of the Internet,  Agents and
there reletivly primitive couterparts,  Search Engines,  are finding a
larger and larger role.  The growth of networks in general slows down the
productivity of those involved in the network,  due to the exponential rate
at which the information available multiplies (and thus the increase in
effort required to find <i>relevent</i> information).
<p>
Agentspace is a possible answer to this complexity.   Agentspace is the name
given to an Information Agent, written by myself<font size=1> 1</font>.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">What is an Information Agent?</font></b>
<p>
An Information Agent is a piece of Platform independent data which can
contain information like variables,  executable code,  and potentially
<i>any form of data</i>.  Agentspace uses simple strings to contain
variables and variable data,  as well as defined compartments,  such as
Execution Priority, and Codespace
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Data Gathering and Remote Execution</font></b><br>
<p>
Agentspace agents are the base of a much wider system,  that is provided by
many other systems.  The current interface to creation and modification of
Agentspace is a perl5 module (called Agent).  The remote execution is also
provided through a perl5 module,  called penguin,  along with the
PenguinAgent interface (a module I am writing at the moment).  The transport
is provided through the IO::Socket module,  and a client/server based
system.  However,  this is my system.   Because of the nature of the actual
Agentspace agents,  any other system that is capable of splitting a string
into pieces could also be used to modify Agentspace.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Portablitiy</font></b><br>
<p>
In a system like an agent,  where the idea is for the information to move
around constantly,  a key issue is portablity.  Agentspace tackles this by
removing certain issues of portablity, such as <i>specific language
dependence</i>.  Agentspace is merely a way of packing data into a tangible
form.  Any language that can perform uudecoding,  and splitting/joining of
strings is capable of providing a stable platform for any Agentspace agent.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Availability</font></b><br>
<p>
The perl5 code needed for implementing Agentspace 2.9 is available from any
CPAN <font size="1">4</font> site,  in my (JDUNCAN) ID directory.  It is
also available from ftp.hawk.igs.net in the directory pub/users/jduncan/Agent.
<p>
Agentspace is a royalty free concept,  along with Agent (the perl5
implementation), which is distributed under the same license as perl itself.
