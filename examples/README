Agent Examples
--------------

There are four sample agents provided with this distribution of Agent:
   *	the Loop agent - repeatedly sends the message 'hi' to another loop
	agent.  This one can be invoked in one of two ways: as an initiator
	or as a reciever.  An initiator starts the loop, while a reciever
	waits for the loop to be started.

   *	the Static agent - allows an agent to execute on the host machine.
	Acts as an 'agent server' of sorts.

   *	the HelloWorld agent - transports itself to a remote address, and
	attempts to print 'Hello World' on the remote screen.

   *	the SpaceFree agent - transports itself to a remote addresses, and
	attempts to find out how much space is free on each host,
	printing a summary on the last host it reaches.

I haven't the time to create a more complicated agent than those listed,
but if anybody comes up with one, I'd be more than happy to include it with
the full release.

Usage is contained within each file.
