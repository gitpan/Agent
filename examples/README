Agent Perl Examples

There are now 5 example agents distributed with Agent Perl:

   *	the Loop agent - repeatedly sends the message 'hi' to another loop
	agent.  This one can be invoked in one of two ways: as an initiator
	or as a reciever.  An initiator starts the loop, while a reciever
	waits for the loop to be started.

   *	the Static agent - allows an agent to execute on the host machine.
	Acts as an 'agent server' of sorts.

   *	the HelloWorld agent - transports itself to a remote address, and
	attempts to print 'Hello World' on the remote screen.

   *	the FreeSpace agent - transports itself to a remote addresses, and
	attempts to find out how much space is free on each host,
	printing a summary on the last host it reaches.

   *	the Eval agent - jumps to remote host, eval()s code there & returns
	results to a specified TCP address.

Along with these examples comes:

   *	Template.pa - a template file for writing agents.

   *	dcalc.pl - uses Eval agents to perform a simple distributed
	calculation with random numbers.

Try 'perldoc <filename>' to get an in-depth description and summary of
usage for each file.


If anybody comes up with any agents they'd like to share with the rest of
the world, I'd be more than happy to include them with the next release.
